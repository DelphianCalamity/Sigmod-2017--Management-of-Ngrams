Q background acute myeloid leukemia aml is a hematopoietic malignancy of clonal myeloid progenitor cells arrested at an immature differentiation stage there is substantial phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity due to the acquisition of different genetic and or epigenetic alterations in leukemia initiating cells 1 acute myeloid leukemia with complex karyotype ck aml is a distinct biological entity traditionally defined by the presence of at least three independent chromosome aberrations excluding t 8 21 inv 16 t 16 16 and t 15 17 and is associated with a very poor outcome 2 3 more than 150 genes have been shown to be differentially expressed in ck aml compared to aml with normal karyotype including several genes located on 5q and 7q as well as genes involved in dna repair chromosome segregation and within the actin cytoskeleton 4 ck aml often contains deletions of 5q 7q and 17p and shows high incidence of somatic alterations of tp53 5 7 besides these characteristic deletions complex karyotypes frequently contain deletions of the chromosomal region 12p13 8 10 the reported minimal deleted region of 12p13 spans two putative tumor suppressor genes etv6 and cdkn1b 11 13 for both genes haploinsufficiency as the underlying mechanism was previously suggested as they are located within the minimal deleted region and inactivation of the second allele is rarely seen 12 14 15 furthermore haploinsufficiency of cdkn1b is strongly implicated in numerous cancer types the vast majority of lymphatic origin 16 17 etv6 ets translocation variant gene 6 a member of the ets transcription factor family shows several properties of a putative tumor suppressor gene like induction of g1 arrest and blocking of ras induced transformation 18 induction of apoptosis 19 and activation of tp53 dependent pathways 20 cdkn1b encodes the p27cdkn1b protein which belongs to the cip kip class of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors and inactivates the cyclin e cdk2 complex via binding of cdkn1b to cyclin e cdk2 21 cdkn1b is hence an important negative regulator of the cell cycle in this study we aimed to investigate whether and how etv6 and cdkn1b are inactivated by small deletions mutations or dna methylation in the specific subgroup of ck aml results standard karyotyping and genomic profiling of 12p13 we extensively characterized a cohort of 79 patients with ck aml thirty nine of them 49 showed a loss of 12p13 according to karyotyping additional file 1 table s1 this included deletions of 12p13 due to interstitial deletions unbalanced translocations and monosomy 12 a monosomy 12 was observed in 13 patients a deletion of 12p13 either by interstitial or terminal deletion or by additive chromosomal material in 21 patients and a dicentric or derivative chromosome with loss of 12p in five patients the frequency of cytogenetically detectable 5 5q 7 7q or 17 17p did not differ in the groups of ck aml with and without 12p13 deletion analyzed with fisher s exact test p values 5 5q 0.81 7 7q 0.17 17 17p 0.36 in 43 patients dna was available for genomic profiling array comparative genomic hybridization arraycgh or single nucleotide polymorphism snp arrays to determine the allelic status of 12p13 and delineate the breakpoints of 12p more closely in 26 of these patients we used arraycgh methods 244 k array 2.8 k array and 8.0 k array five patients were analyzed by using the snp 250 k array and 12 patients were analyzed by using the snp 6.0 array in summary in 20 of 43 patients 47 losses of 12p13 could be identified by genomic profiling encompassing the etv6 and cdkn1b genes with this approach three patients were newly detected to carry a deletion in 12p13 61 64 77 however in six patients 13 22 36 41 69 70 a loss of 12p13 according to karyotyping was not confirmed additional file 1 table s1 small interstitial deletions within the chromosomal region 12p13 were identified in 13 of 43 patients with ck aml analyzed by arraycgh and snp arrays the distal breakpoints mapped within a region of 30 kb directly 5 to etv6 except in one patient 48 where the first deleted probe was localized in the 3 utr of etv6 the proximal breakpoints were all downstream of gprc5d g protein coupled receptor family c group 5 the minimal deleted region in our cohort spanned 1.43 mb and included cdkn1b and the 3 utr of etv6 figure 1 figure 1 interstitial 12p13 deletions arraycgh results 244 k agilent showing interstitial 12p13 deletions in six patients the genomic profiles are zoomed in to the minimal deleted region covering etv6 at the telomeric site and cdkn1b at the centromeric site deleted regions are highlighted in gray next to the breakpoint region given in mb the size of the deletion is shown the etv6 gene is orientated in 5 3 direction mean log ratios of the deletions correlate with the clone size according to karyotyping 12p13 deletion breakpoints a graphic overview of the 12p13 deletion breakpoints including or excluding etv6 and cdkn1b from different studies also comprising our data is shown in figure 2 most of these studies refer to ck aml or contain a large number of patients with aml some studies reported minimal deleted regions containing either etv6 or cdkn1b however in the majority of studies the minimal deleted region covered both etv6 and cdkn1b figure 2 12p minimal deleted regions from different studies the ideogram of the chromosome arm 12p is shown on the left the region from 11.8 mb to 12.9 mb is zoomed in to the genes etv6 bcl2l14 lrp6 dusp16 and cdkn1b given as black bars the red bars to the right of the genes indicate the minimal deleted regions as described in the different studies shown below most of these studies refer to ck aml or contain a large number of patients with aml the red bar on the right displays the minimal deleted region identified in this study a dashed line indicates that the border of the deletion is not exactly determined or exceeds the selected chromosomal region mutation analyses of etv6 cdkn1b and tp53 to further determine the modes of inactivation of etv6 nm_001987 and cdkn1b nm_004064 we performed mutation analyses of all coding exons of etv6 in 56 patients and of cdkn1b in 67 patients with and without 12p13 deletions for which dna was available additional file 1 table s1 in our cohort of ck aml no cdkn1b mutations were identified however in etv6 we found a distinct and novel heterozygous frameshift mutation of exon 4 c 391dupt p ser131phefster23 in one patient 21 figure 3 this frameshift mutation lies within the n terminal homodimerization domain and theoretically would disturb homodimerization thus leading to a complete loss of the dna binding ets domain a deleterious effect was confirmed by using the platform provean for non synonymous or indel variants and prediction of functional effects http provean jcvi org index php 22 the mutation was detected at the time point of relapse importantly in the first diagnostic sample of this patient still showing a normal karyotype the etv6 mutation was present indicating that this mutation emerged early in the course of the disease in the following samples during the course of the disease a complex karyotype with several balanced translocations and a terminal deletion of 14q was detected additional file 1 table s1 by means of arraycgh no gains or losses in the region of the etv6 gene were evident notably no tp53 flt3 nor cebpa mutations data not shown and no typical cytogenetic aberrations of ck aml like del 5q 7 del 7q or del 17p were present in this patient however an npm1 mutation c 860_863dup p trp288cysfster12 was identified data not shown figure 3 etv6 mutation heterozygous frame shift mutation in exon 4 c 391dupt p ser131phefster23 leading to truncated protein due to a newly generated stop codon patient 21 to determine the frequency of tp53 mutations in the subgroup with and without 12p13 deletions we performed mutation analysis of all coding exons of tp53 in all 79 patients in 44 of 79 patients 56 tp53 mutations were identified see additional file 2 table s2 the frequency of 12p13 alterations was similar in patients with and without a monoallelic or biallelic inactivation of tp53 45.5 versus 45.7 p 0.99 methylation analyses of etv6 and cdkn1b to determine the methylation status of etv6 and cdkn1b quantitative methylation analysis of the 5 utrs of both genes was performed by pyrosequencing we examined 23 single cpg sites within the etv6 5 utr cpg island and 22 single cpg sites within the cdkn1b 5 utr cpg island in 55 patients 27 with 12p13 deletions 28 without 12p13 deletions the mean methylation levels of etv6 and cdkn1b ranged from 0 to 1.43 and 0.09 to 1.77 respectively figure 4 additional file 1 table s1 these results did not exceed the cut off levels of 5 indicative for increased methylation neither did the methylation degree of single cpg sites in the patients exceed the cut off level in summary no evidence of increased methylation of the 5 utr of either gene was found figure 4 methylation analyses of etv6 and cdkn1b a1 a2 schematic view of the etv6 cdkn1b cpg islands each vertical bar represents a single cpg site arrows indicate

pyrogram c1 c2 mean methylation levels of the 23 cpg sites in the 5 utr of etv6 and the 22 cpg sites in the 5 utr of cdkn1b of all patients analyzed are shown as a percentage the standard deviation was determined using the kruskal wallis test expression profiling of the genes within the minimal deleted region as we showed that gene dosages of etv6 and cdkn1b were reduced to half the normal level in ck aml samples with 12p13 deletion we were interested to determine whether this is reflected on the transcriptional level therefore we first evaluated the gene dosage effect based on our previously published gene expression profiling 23 24 expression and genomic data were available for four of our own patients with ck aml and deletion in 12p13 and for 28 cases without deletion in 12p13 the four ck aml patients with deletion in 12p13 showed a significantly lower expression level for the deleted genes than ck aml without deletion in 12p13 p 0.001 unpaired t test figure 5 a within the four cases with 12p13 deletion we compared the expression level of the genes located in the critical region with those on chromosome 12 outside the deleted region and found a lower expression level for the deleted genes figure 5 b figure 5 12p13 deletion associated gene dosage effect a comparison of ck aml with n 4 and without 12p13 deletion n 28 the box plot shows the expression values for the genes

were obtained from the tcga network http cancergenome nih gov in addition we screened the publicly available data of the cancer genome atlas tcga http cancergenome nih gov for ck aml patients with and without deletion in 12p13 we compared eight cases of ck aml with deletion in 12p13 and eight cases of ck aml without deletion in 12p13 etv6 and cdkn1b are expressed in ck aml with and without deletion in 12p13 etv6 del12p 37.68 12.95 rpkm etv6 no del12p 71.63 34.43 rpkm cdkn1b del12p 15.19 4.06 rpkm cdkn1b no del12p 24.73 5.86 rpkm notably the expression level of etv6 and cdkn1b decreased significantly by 0.53 fold p 0.03 and 0.62 fold p 0.003 respectively in cases with 12p13 deletions compared to those without 12p13 deletions the other candidate genes located within the minimal deleted region bcl2l14 lrp6 dusp16 and gprc5d showed no or very low expression levels irrespective of their copy number status 0.13 3.72 rpkm see figure 5 c discussion 12p13 deletions are common in a broad spectrum of hematological malignancies notably in myelodysplastic syndrome mds with monosomy 7 25 and ck aml 8 10 etv6 and cdkn1b are the candidate tumor suppressor genes within the region 12p13 12 13 other candidate genes within the minimal deleted region like bcl2l14 lrp6 dusp16 and gprc5d may also play a role in tumorigenesis and leukemogenesis however we now demonstrate according to the expression data provided by tcga in confirmation of data published by haferlach et al that these genes do not show any expression or very low expression in blood or bone marrow cells of aml patients 26 likewise using the platform hemaexplorer http servers binf ku dk hemaexplorer they show a low expression in normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells compared to the expression level of etv6 5 to 40 fold higher and cdkn1b 3 to 20 fold higher in these cells 26 it seems unlikely that they play a major role in leukemogenesis see figure 5 c recent data suggest that the function of some tumor suppressor genes can be disrupted solely by haploinsufficiency leading to reduced gene dosage which might be sufficient to contribute to tumorigenesis 27 29 popular examples are tp53 pten npm1 nf1 and rps14 27 29 likewise for the genes apc atm brca1 2 and rb haploinsufficiency contributes to tumorigenesis 28 haploinsufficiency of cdkn1b is strongly implicated in numerous cancer types the vast majority of lymphatic origin 16 17 cdkn1b heterozygous mice are predisposed to tumors in multiple tissues 30 etv6 and cdkn1b are known to be inactivated mostly by monoallelic deletions yet the mode of inactivation has not been investigated in detail in ck aml with a high frequency of 12p13 deletions in our study 12p13 deletions mostly small interstitial deletions were present in nearly half 49 of the analyzed ck aml patients according to karyotype in 20 of 43 patients 47 losses of 12p13 could be identified by genomic profiling of those 13 small interstitial deletions see additional file 1 table s1 the high frequency may be explained by high resolution arrays used in this study in previous studies based on karyotyping or snp arrays of lower resolution the frequency of 12p13 deletions in ck aml was 27 31 and 18 10 respectively however it cannot be excluded that the rather high frequency in our study is due to the relatively small size of our cohort the minimal deleted region in our cohort spanned 1.43 mb and included cdkn1b and the 3 utr of etv6 see figure 1 in one patient 48 the distal breakpoint is located within a region between exon 8 and the 3 utr of the etv6 gene as the end of the ets dna binding domain and the highly conserved polyadenylation signal lay within the deleted region and differential polyadenylation of the 3 utr of etv6 plays a major role in posttranscriptional modification 32 we assume that etv6 is contained in the minimal deleted region etv6 and cdkn1b mutations have never been investigated specifically in ck aml somatic etv6 mutations are rare events in newly diagnosed aml 33 aml m0 34 and mds 35 we detected one heterozygous frameshift mutation among 56 patients see figure 3 additional file 1 table s1 our results thereby confirm the low rate of etv6 mutations in the distinct subgroup of ck aml the detected frameshift mutation lies within the n terminal homodimerization domain leading to a complete loss of the dna binding ets domain the vast majority of all reported etv6 mutations results in inactivation of one etv6 allele which is consistent with haploinsufficiency as the underlying mechanism there was no typical driver alteration like tp53 or flt3 mutations and no typical cytogenetic aberrations of ck aml like del 5q 7 del 7q or del 17p present in this patient which could provide a proliferative advantage or even initiate leukemogenesis this might strengthen the role of this etv6 mutation as a driver rather than a passenger mutation unfortunately no fibroblast dna was available to prove whether the etv6 mutation was of germline origin however this seems to be unlikely as etv6 is a critical regulator in the survival of multiple cell types during early embryonic development and etv6 knockout mice are embryonically lethal 36 according to the literature cdkn1b mutations have been previously reported in childhood leukemia 37 and rarely in t cell prolymphocytic leukemia 16 as well as in adult t cell leukemia 38 we did not identify a mutation in the cdkn1b gene in our analyzed patient cohort see additional file 1 table s1 as expected in more than half of the analyzed patients tp53 mutations were detected see additional file 2 table s2 however the frequency of 12p13 deletions did not differ between patients with and without a monoallelic or biallelic alteration of tp53 45.5 versus 45.7 p 0.99 one mechanism of haploinsufficiency is increased methylation leading to reduced gene dosage due to transcriptional silencing for etv6 increased methylation was suggested as a possible mechanism since decreased etv6 protein expression was reported in aml patients 33 hypermethylation of cdkn1b was excluded in not further defined aml and mds but found in the lymphoblast like cell line raji 39 we demonstrate here that the cpg islands within the etv6 and cdkn1b 5 utrs are not hypermethylated in ck aml see figure 4 to our knowledge this is the first report that excludes 5 utr methylation leading to etv6 and cdkn1b inactivation in ck aml and supports haploinsufficiency by heterozygous deletions as mode of inactivation we show by reanalysis of our previously published gene expression profiling 23 24 of patients with ck aml and deletion in 12p13 a significantly lower expression level for the deleted genes p 0.001 compared to a group of ck aml patients without 12p13 alteration see figure 5 a b furthermore we screened the publicly available data of tcga and demonstrate that the other candidate genes located within the minimal deleted region bcl2l14 lrp6 dusp16 and gprc5d show no or very low expression levels irrespective of their copy number in contrast etv6 and cdkn1b are expressed in ck aml and their expression levels significantly decreased in cases with 12p13 deletions see figure 5 c thus etv6 and cdkn1b are the sole genes within the minimal deleted region with expression levels reduced to approximately half these data strongly support our hypothesis that haploinsufficiency is the underlying mechanism of inactivation of etv6 and cdkn1b conclusion in summary we demonstrate that the putative tumor suppressor genes etv6 and cdkn1b are frequently inactivated by loss of one copy most frequently by small deletions of 12p13 in ck aml the expression level of etv6 and cdkn1b is significantly decreased in cases with 12p13 deletions whereas the other potential candidate genes within the minimal deleted region do not show any or very low expression irrespective of their copy number status mutations and hypermethylation as mode of inactivation were largely excluded it is possible that the genomic complexity leads to acquisition of the deletion in 12p13 future studies investigating clonal evolution should clarify whether haploinsufficiency of both genes may cooperate early in the process of leukemic transformation by disordering key processes of differentiation and proliferation and whether they may also play a critical role in the induction of chromosomal instability finally resulting in the development of clones with complex karyotypes methods patients 79 patients with ck aml were analyzed see additional file 1 table s1 complex karyotype was defined by the presence of at least three chromosomal abnormalities in the absence of the prognostically favorable t 8 21 q22 q22 inv 16 p13q22 or t 16 16 p13 q22 and t 15 17 q22 q12 the diagnosis of aml was
